## Recommended Reading Order

For new developers, the recommended reading order is 
- Onboarding
- Installation
- SRS v2.4
- SDD v2.4
- VDD v2.4
- User Manual

The other folders contain documentation on elicitation work, early developmental ideas, and some beginning work on front-end development before that was overtaken by actual coding.
