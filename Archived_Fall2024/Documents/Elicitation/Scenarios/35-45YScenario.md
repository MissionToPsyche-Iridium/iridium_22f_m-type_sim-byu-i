# Scenario 4: NASA Psyche Mission Engineer/Scientist

## Title: Preparing for a Critical Mission Phase

### Description:

Jordan, a 40-year-old NASA engineer working on the Psyche mission, is tasked with coordinating data analysis and simulation tasks for the upcoming launch. They need to run simulations to assess potential risks and validate mission parameters, all while collaborating with international teams through video conferencing and shared software tools.

### Requirements Insights:

- The simulation must include real-time data updates and robust data analysis capabilities for risk assessment.
- Compatibility with existing NASA software tools is critical to streamline workflows and communication among team members.
- A system for logging and tracking changes to simulations and data analysis would help maintain accuracy and accountability.
