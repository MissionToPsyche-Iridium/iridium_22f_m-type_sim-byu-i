# NASA Psyche - M-type Asteroid Sampling Simulator

"The NASA Psyche mission is a mission to the metal-rich (or M-type) asteroid, Psyche, in the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter. The spacecraft, which launched in October 2023 and will arrive at the asteroid in mid-2029, will study the asteroid from orbit and will not land on the surface.  It is possible to imagine, however, that after learning about Psyche from orbit, there may be scientists and engineers interested in proposing a future mission to send a robotic lander or rover to sample the surface. To prepare for such a mission, extensive simulations would need to be done ahead of time, taking into account the unique characteristics of the Psyche asteroid. In this project, you will design, create, and test a software model or simulation that would aide in preparation for the process of sampling from the surface of the Psyche asteroid, focusing on the mechanics and logistics of surface sampling operations. The format of the final deliverable is flexible and could be demonstrated via VR, AR, or some web-based or gamified format if time and the skills and interests of the team allow."
