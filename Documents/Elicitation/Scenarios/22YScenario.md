# Scenario 1: College Senior (Astrophysics Major)

## Title: Navigating Academic Challenges in Astrophysics Research

### Description:

Alex, a 22-year-old college senior majoring in astrophysics, is preparing for an important presentation on the Psyche mission. With a tight schedule filled with lectures, lab work, and part-time tutoring, Alex uses the Psyche simulation tool to visualize data about the asteroid. They need to quickly analyze results from their latest research and incorporate these findings into their presentation.

### Requirements Insights:

- The simulation tool should offer easy access to relevant data sets and visualizations that help students understand complex concepts.
- An integrated feature for collaboration (e.g., shared workspaces) is necessary for students working together on projects.
- A user-friendly interface is essential, as the target user may not have extensive programming experience.
